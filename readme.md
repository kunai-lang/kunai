Kunai is a general-purpose low-level, object-oriented, type-safe, and statically-typed programming language.

This repository contains the source code for the Kunai compiler, and other tools/utilities. **Note:** This project is still in early stages of development. This means there likely wont be any pre-built binaries, features *will* be missing(or broken), and the code is a mess. If you notice any bugs, please open an issue!

## To-Do
*coming soon!*
